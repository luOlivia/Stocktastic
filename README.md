## Inspiration
When you invest your hard-earned dollars into the stock market, you want to be confident that you'll make a profit. We know what its like to invest in some stock, only for it to drop value soon after without notice. That's why we made Stocktastic to help you to invest easily and efficiently.

## What it does
Say goodbye to endless market watching and hello to the future of investing. Keep your portfolio at the tip of your fingertips. Anywhere. Anytime. We get real-time market data and let you know when before there is a major change in the value of your portfolio.

Everyone hates that feeling when you unexpectedly see your portfolio drop in value. Or when some stock went up but you missed out on investing in it. Stocktastic lets you know before that happens so you can stay on top of your portfolio.

We connect to your 'bank account', through the Capital One Nessie API to get your account balance and other information. Then we look at what stocks you invest in and their trends. We take your account balance and the recent stock trends to advise you on whether to keep investing in that stock. We also send notifications, through Twilio, to your phone as soon as the stock market has a major change--keeping you on top of your stock portfolio at all times.

## Build With
We used javascript to script the stock graphs, integrate our APIs, and create the advice algorithm. We used HTML/CSS to make it look good.
